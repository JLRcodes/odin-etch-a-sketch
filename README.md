**Etch-A-Sketch**

Etch-A-Sketch is a mechanical drawing toy made in the 1960's

An Etch A Sketch has a thick, flat gray screen in a red plastic frame. There are two white knobs on the front of the frame in the lower corners. Twisting the knobs moves a stylus that displaces aluminum powder on the back of the screen, leaving a solid line. The knobs create lineographic (_Lineographic is the art of drawing without lifting the pen, pencil, or paintbrush that is being used_) images. The left control moves the stylus horizontally, and the right one moves it vertically.
